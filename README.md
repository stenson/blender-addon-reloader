# Reloader

A very simple Blender addon to expose a keyboard shortcut to reload other addons.

How to run locally (to install this project):

- Clone it & cd into the directory
- `python3 -m pip install b3denv`
- `. ./setup.sh`
- `blender`

And now you'll need to enable it from the plugins preferences.
